# Project for Programming and Scripting - Iris Data Set Analysis

Author: Anna Lozenko

The Iris dataset was created in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It consists of measurments of 150 Iris flowers from 3 species, with 50 samples per species:

- *Iris setosa*

- *Iris versicolor*

- *Iris virginica*


The dataset contains data on 4 important features, used to describe the physical characteristics of the Iris flowers:

1. Sepal length (cm)

2. Sepal width (cm)

3. Petal length (cm)

4. Petal width (cm)

The Iris dataset is widely used today in statistics and machine learning. It is a valuable resource for learning and practicing data analysis techniques due to its simplicity.

## Iris dataset analysis outline:

1. Exploration of the dataset, description of its components.

2. Statistical analysis of the 4 features of Iris: mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The results of the analysis are stored in a separate text file included in the repository.

3. Analysis of the distribution of the 4 features of Iris through histogram plots. Plots images are stored in separate png files included in the repository.

4. Pairwise analysis of Iris features through scatterplots.

5. Analysis of data distribution through boxplots. Comparison of the features distribution among the 3 Iris species.
